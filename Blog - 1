API-led connectivity is a layered architecture approach where integrations are broken into reusable APIs organized into three distinct layers:

-System APIs
-Process APIs
-Experience APIs

Instead of tightly coupling systems together, everything communicates through managed APIs.
Now let’s understand each layer in depth.

System APIs (Foundation Layer)

Purpose: - Expose backend systems in a controlled and reusable way.

What they do:

- Connect to databases
- Connect to SAP
- Connect to Salesforce
- Connect to legacy systems
- Hide system complexity

Important Characteristics:

- No business logic
- Just expose system data cleanly
- Reusable across multiple processes

Example:

A System API for Customer DB:

GET /customers/{id}
POST /customers


Process APIs (Business Logic Layer)

Purpose: Orchestrate multiple System APIs and apply business rules.

What they do:

- Combine data from multiple systems
- Apply validations
- Perform transformations
- Implement business workflows

Example:

To fetch full customer details:

 - Call Customer System API
 - Call Orders System API
 - Merge data
 - Return unified response

This layer contains:

- DataWeave transformations
- Routing
- Orchestration
- Business rules

Experience APIs (Channel-Specific Layer)

Purpose: Provide data formatted specifically for client applications.

Different channels need different formats:

- Mobile
- Web
- Partner system

Example:
Mobile app might need:
{
  name,
  lastOrderDate
}
Web app might need:
{
  name,
  email,
  orderHistory,
  loyaltyPoints
}

Both call the same Process API but format response differently.

Why API-led Connectivity is Important
1. Reusability - System APIs can be reused across multiple projects.
2. Loose Coupling - Front-end changes do not impact backend systems.
3. Scalability - Each layer can scale independently.
4. Faster Development - Teams can work independently on different layers.
5. Governance & Security - Policies can be applied centrally through API Manager.


Real-World Example (Banking Scenario)

Imagine:

Mobile App → Check Balance
Web App → Account Dashboard
ATM → Withdraw Money

Instead of all directly calling core banking:

You build:

System API → Core Banking
Process API → Account Services
Experience APIs → Mobile / Web / ATM

Now:

- Core banking changes → only System API changes
- Mobile UI changes → only Experience API changes

Very clean separation.

Take away how to Answer in Interviews

API-led connectivity is a layered architectural approach in MuleSoft where integrations are divided into System, Process, and Experience APIs. 
System APIs expose backend systems, Process APIs handle business orchestration, and Experience APIs tailor responses for specific channels. 
This approach improves reusability, loose coupling, scalability, and governance.
